# London Bike Sharing Dataset - Cleaned Data and Tableau Visualizations

This project involves cleaning the London Bike Sharing Dataset and creating visualizations using Tableau.

## Cleaned Data

The cleaned dataset is available in the [cleaned_data](cleaned_data/) directory. It includes the following files:

- `cleaned_bike_sharing_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset with preprocessed and transformed features.

### Data Cleaning Process

1. **Data Cleaning Script**: The data cleaning process is documented in the Jupyter Notebook [`data_cleaning.ipynb`](data_cleaning.ipynb). This notebook contains the Python code used for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data.

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the data cleaning script by running `python data_cleaning.py`.

## Tableau Visualizations

Tableau visualizations created from the cleaned data are available in the [Tableau_Visualizations](Tableau_Visualizations/) directory. Key visualizations include:

- `daily_rentals_dashboard.twb`: Tableau Workbook for exploring daily bike rentals.
- `seasonal_trends_dashboard.twb`: Tableau Workbook highlighting seasonal trends.

### How to View Tableau Visualizations

1. **Download Tableau**: Make sure you have Tableau installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download).

2. **Open Tableau Workbooks**: Open the desired Tableau Workbook (`.twb`) file to explore the visualizations.
