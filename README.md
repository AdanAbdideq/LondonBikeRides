# London Bike Sharing Dataset
This project encompasses comprehensive data processing, encompassing tasks such as data cleaning, manipulation, organization, and subsequent visualization of the London Bike Sharing Dataset. Through a series of meticulous steps, raw data has been transformed, cleaned, and organized to derive meaningful insights. The processed data is then utilized to create informative visualizations using Tableau, allowing for a deeper understanding and exploration of key patterns, trends, and relationships within the London Bike Sharing Dataset

## Cleaned Data

The cleaned dataset is available in the [cleaned_data](bikes.xlsx/) directory. It includes the following files:

- `cleaned_bike_sharing_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset with preprocessed and transformed features.

### Data Cleaning Process

1. **Data Cleaning Script**: The data cleaning process is documented in the Jupyter Notebook [`index.ipynb`](index.ipynb). This notebook contains the Python code used for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data.

## Tableau Visualizations

Tableau visualizations created from the cleaned data are available in the [Tableau_Visualizations](London BikeRide .twbx/) directory. Key visualizations include:

- `Count of London BIkes Rides`: Tableau Workbook for exploring daily bike rentals.
- `seasonal_trends_dashboard.twb`: Tableau Workbook highlighting seasonal trends.
- `Temperature Vs Wind speed` : Tableau Workbook heatmap of temperature vs wind speed.

### How to View Tableau Visualizations

1. **Download Tableau**: Make sure you have Tableau installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/LondonBikeRide_17062582592720/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

2. **Open Tableau Workbooks**: Open the desired Tableau Workbook (`.twb`) file to explore the visualizations.
